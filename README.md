# 1. Set Up SAP GUI Scripting
Firstly, ensure that SAP GUI Scripting is enabled on your SAP system and client machine. This involves:
- Enabling scripting in SAP GUI via transaction `RZ11`.
- Configuring SAP GUI settings to allow scripting (usually found under `Customize Local Layout` -> `Options` -> `Accessibility & Scripting`).
# 2. Develop the SAP GUI Script
Write a SAP GUI Script that navigates through the SAP transaction `ZS86` (assuming it's a custom transaction for sales order extraction) and extracts the data.
